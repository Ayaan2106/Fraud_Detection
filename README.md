# Fraud Detection on Transaction Data

This project explores fraud detection on a highly imbalanced transaction dataset using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle (PaySim simulator):
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1

Due to file size limits, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## How to run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Place the CSV file in the project directory
3. Run the notebook `Fraud_Detection_Prediction.ipynb`

## Key Work
- Exploratory data analysis on imbalanced fraud data
- Feature engineering on account balance changes
- Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Threshold tuning using precision–recall analysis
- Evaluation of false positives vs fraud recall trade-offs
