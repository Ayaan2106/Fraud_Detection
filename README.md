# Fraud_Detection
## Fraud Detection on Transaction Data

This project explores fraud detection on a highly imbalanced transaction dataset using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

Rather than optimising for accuracy, the focus is on recall for fraudulent transactions and understanding the trade-offs between missed fraud and false positives. Model performance is evaluated using precision–recall curves, ROC/PR AUC, and confusion matrices.

Decision thresholds are tuned using predicted probabilities to improve fraud recall from ~88% to ~96%, and results are analysed in terms of real-world operational impact.
